    <p class="info">
      <b>Gas Gas</b> is a Spanish motorcycle manufacturer established in 1985 by Narcìs Casas and Josep Pibernat
      in Salt, Girona. <br><br>The company specializes in off-road motorcycles for trials and enduro
      competitions. <b>Gas Gas</b> was purchased by KTM motorcycles in 2019. After the sale to
      KTM, Gas Gas's off-road models were purchased by Spanish motorcycle manufacturer Rieju.<br><br>
      In 1973, Narcìs Casas and Josep Pibernat began operating a Bultaco motorcycle franchise in Salt.
      With the financial demise of the Bultaco factory in 1979, Casas and Pibernat began importing
      <i>Italian SWM motorcycles</i> until 1984 when, the manufacturer ceased operations.<br><br>
      In 2014, <b>Gas Gas</b> merged with Spanish motorcycle manufacturer Ossa and was ultimately acquired
      by the Torrot Group in 2015. In 2019, <b>Gas Gas</b> was purchased by KTM motorcycles.
